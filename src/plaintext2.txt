NEED FOR SECRECY IN DESIGNING SECURITY SYSTEMS IT IS WISE TO ASSUME THAT THE DETAILS OF THE 
CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHM ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE TO THE ATTACKER THIS IS KNOWN 
AS KERCKHOFFS PRINCIPLE  ONLY SECRECY OF THE KEY PROVIDES SECURITY OR 
REFORMULATED AS SHANNONS MAXIM THE ENEMY KNOWS THE SYSTEM THE HISTORY 
OF CRYPTOGRAPHY PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO KEEP 
THE DETAILS OF A WIDELY USED ALGORITHM SECRET SEE SECURITY THROUGH 
OBSCURITY A KEY IS OFTEN EASIER TO PROTECT ITS TYPICALLY A SMALL 
PIECE OF INFORMATION THAN AN ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM AND EASIER TO 
CHANGE IF COMPROMISED THUS THE SECURITY OF AN ENCRYPTION SYSTEM 
IN MOST CASES RELIES ON SOME KEY 

BEING KEPT SECRET TRYING TO KEEP KEYS SECRET IS ONE OF THE MOST 
DIFFICULT PROBLEMS IN PRACTICAL CRYPTOGRAPHY SEE KEY MANAGEMENT 
AN ATTACKER WHO OBTAINS THE KEY BY FOR EXAMPLE THEFT EXTORTION 
DUMPSTER DIVING ASSAULT TORTURE OR SOCIAL ENGINEERING CAN RECOVER 
THE ORIGINAL MESSAGE FROM THE ENCRYPTED DATA AND ISSUE SIGNATURES
